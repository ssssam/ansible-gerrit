# Gerrit modules for Ansible.

I just hacked this up in two days so don't expect too much from it yet.

## Dependencies

  - [pygerrit]
  - [requests]

[pygerrit]: https://www.github.com/sonyxperiadev/pygerrit
[requests]: http://www.python-requests.org/

## Usage

In order to share code between the self-contained module files, there's a
simple Makefile you need to run to generate the final .py files. It simply
concatenates `common.py` with each `module.py.in` file, and should be run like
this:

    make
